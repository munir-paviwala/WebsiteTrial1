                <p>In this project, I highlight and explore the theories which are often called together as 'new materialism'.</p>
                <p>Following that, I highlight how this theory can help shape a new kind of environmental history—a way of history which de-centers the humans from the narratives of environmental history.</p>
                <p>I argue that new materialism can offer a nuanced and complex understanding of the interaction between humans and non-humans in the past.</p>

            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>This website-essay will explore the various theories under the roof called 'new materialism', and then try to understand how these might affect the ways in which we study environmental history. To understand how such histories are possible, this online project will explore the case of two of the major works that have taken steps in such a direction. It ends by highlighting some of the limitations of such narratives, and with a note on the future direction of research.</p>

            <p>Have you ever considered how the objects around you affect your life and the world? If so, you might be interested in learning about New Materialism.</p>
            <p>Broadly, New Materialism is a theoretical framework that emphasizes the active role of material things and the material world in shaping human experiences and social structures.</p>
            <p style="color:#c2274b">It challenges traditional dualisms between the <b>human and non-human</b>, mind and body, and <b>nature and culture.</b></p>
            <p><b>Now, what does that mean?</b></p>
            <p>To illustrate what New Materialism means in practice, let’s take a look at an example that might help us; the example is <b>‘Smartphone usage’</b>.</p>
            <b><p>In a traditional dualistic view:</p></b>

                    <p>In a New Materialist perspective, the user and the smartphone are not separate entities but are entangled in a complex relationship. The smartphone is not just a passive tool; it actively shapes and influences the user's behavior and experiences.</p>

                    <p>Instead of seeing the smartphone as purely a cultural artifact, New Materialism invites us to consider the natural resources, energy, and environmental impact involved in producing and maintaining the device. This blurs the boundaries between nature and culture, highlighting the ecological footprint of technological objects.</p>

                <h1>Affect and Assemblages</h1>
                <p>Deleuze and Guattari's ontology reanalyzes the processes of social production based on a conceptual framework of Spinoza's monist philosophy. The focus is on everyday interactions rather than social structures and top-down power. Their materialism regards human bodies and all other materials, social and abstract entities, not as essences but as fully relational and contingent. These materials gain their capacity as they are drawn into assemblages.</p>
                <p class="quote-text">"DeleuzoGuattarian materialism regards human bodies and all other material, social and abstract entities as relational, having no ontological status or integrity until drawn into ‘assemblages’ with other similarly contingent and ephemeral bodies, things and ideas through their capacities to affect or be affected" (Fox & Alldred, 2019).</p>
                <p>What holds assemblages together are the capacities of their components to affect or be affected—a capacity referred to simply as an 'affect'. An affect is a becoming, or in other words a force, whether physical, psychological, socio-cultural, political, economic, emotional, and so on. The flow of affects within assemblages is consequently the means by which lives, societies, and history unfold. It is also the basis for power and resistance.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">Okay here is an attempt for a simpler understanding of the above:</div>
                <p>Deleuzo-Guattarian materialism is a way of looking at the world that says nothing is fixed or stable. Everything is always changing and becoming something else through interactions with other things.</p>

                <h1>Materialist Onto-epistemology</h1>
                <p>One of the most influential new materialist thinkers is Karen Barad. She is a feminist scholar who draws on quantum physics to challenge the conventional ways of understanding reality, knowledge, and science. What if reality and knowledge are not separate, but intertwined? This is the idea behind materialist onto-epistemology, a new framework proposed by Karen Barad. It combines ontology (the study of being) and epistemology (the study of knowing) into one inseparable concept.</p>
                <p>Barad’s work invites us to see the world as a web of entanglements, where matter and meaning are always in the process of becoming, and where agency is distributed across both human and non-human actors.</p>

                <h1>Posthuman and Post-humanities</h1>
                <p>What if humans are not the most important or superior beings in the world? This is the question that Rosi Braidotti asks in her posthuman theory. Rejecting the arrogance of anthropocentrism, Braidotti aligns with the transformative forces of life in its inhuman aspects.</p>
                <p>According to Braidotti, everything in the world is alive and smart, not just humans. She sees matter—including all our bodies—as lively, intelligent, and self-organizing. This perspective blurs the boundaries between nature and culture, breaking down dualisms like man/woman, human/animal, and mind/body.</p>
                <p>Braidotti’s concept of the posthuman challenges the idea that the humanities are only about studying human culture and history. She proposes a new field of study that she calls the ‘post-humanities’, which explores the relations and transformations between humans and non-humans, such as animals, plants, machines, and environments.</p>

                <h1>Actor Network Theory</h1>
                <p>Another new materialist theory that is related to Deleuze and Guattari’s assemblages is actor network theory. Coming from the ‘Science and Technology Studies’, this theory has many intersections with the Deleuzo-Guattarian assemblages theory.</p>
                <p>What if everything in the world is an actor, and everything is a network? This is the basic idea behind actor network theory. The main three principles of the theory are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Agnosticism:</b> Abandoning a priori assumptions about the nature of networks, the accuracy of the actor’s account, or causal links in the network.</li>
                    <li><b>Generalized Symmetry:</b> Dissolving a priori categories about actors (such as human or non-human) and thus, treating every object as similar in the network.</li>
                    <li><b>Free Association:</b> Breaking the boundaries between natural and social phenomena.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Bruno Latour suggests that everything is of equal value and part of the same omnipresent network on a flat ontology. Everything connects to each other in some way. This makes traditional sociologists uncomfortable because how can an object be as important as a human being in a network?</p>
                <p>For example, without the phone, some existing human connections would cease to exist. This is more relevant than ever now since everything is online. How many people would you be able to stay in touch with without technology? Doesn't that give the phone as much agency and importance as us?</p>

                <h1>Thinking Like a Mountain (1949)</h1>
                <p>In this essay, Aldo Leopold shares his personal experience and reflection on the role of wolves in the ecosystem. It is a short two page essay - so poetic that I am willing to even call it a poem. The essay is an account that tries to imagine the world from the perspective of a mountain. It explores how the mountain would have perceived the world around it.</p>
                <p class="quote-text">"Yet behind these obvious and immediate hopes and fears there lies a deeper meaning, known only to the mountain itself. Only the mountain has lived long enough to listen objectively to the howl of a wolf." (Leopold, 1949, p. 1)</p>
                <p>As we can see in the above quote, the spirit of Leopold strives to transcend the human perspective and comprehend the environment. It goes beyond the understanding of human time scales, delving into geological time scales that span centuries and millennia.</p>
                <p class="quote-text">"[The human] has not learned to think like a mountain. Hence we have dustbowls, and rivers washing the future into the sea." (Leopold, 1949, p. 2)</p>
                <p>Despite being ahead of its time and the amazing prose, the essay has one major limitation. The essay is an extremely short narrative of just two pages. Therefore, for the environmental historians, this is a good inspiration, but it does not and can not provide a framework on how we can shape our research output, especially if it goes beyond a few pages. Nonetheless, this remains as an amazing inspiration for any such project.</p>

    <!-- Slide 14: Case Study - Stone: An Ecology of the Inhuman (White Theme) -->
    <section class="slide-container white-slides">
        <div class="slide-content">
            <h1>Stone: An Ecology of the Inhuman (2015)</h1>
            <p>Jeffrey J. Cohen begins by discussing the variety of forms that stone takes, how it shapes our material world, and more importantly - how the stone forms our basis of understanding, often times through metaphors about the world. He refers to the use of stone and lithic entities in the myths and stories that form and shape some of our major belief systems: religion and sciences.</p>
            <p>He also explicitly refers to works of Bruno Latour and Karen Barad, two influential new materialist thinkers that we have discussed earlier.</p>
            <p class="quote-text">“A rock supports, defeats, fosters, yields, impels, risks, resists.” (Cohen, 2015, p. 43)</p>
            <p class="quote-text">[a rock stands for] “vast durations, slow movement, and inhuman scale.” (Cohen, 2015, p. 27)</p>
            <p class="quote-text">“A rock discovered at the shoreline opens an adventure in deep time and inhuman forces: slow sedimentation of alluvium and volcanic ash, grinding tectonic shift, crushing mass and epochal compaction, infernal heat, relentless turbidity of the sea.” (Cohen, 2015, p. 4)</p>
            <p>From these quotes, we can see how the stone has vitality and agency in shaping the world. The above statements bear witness to that fact. But stone also reminds us of the larger time scales, the ephemerality the human in the larger schema of things. It is a humbling experience that reminds us of the limits of the anthropocentric superiority purported by our times.</p>
            <p class="quote-text">“Any speaking of the nonhuman is a translation, and therefore error prone, filled with guesswork, and inclined toward fantasy. Story is a parasitical entity that in its familiar forms clearly depends on humans, but story is also itself a living thing and does not necessarily depend upon language to be conveyed.” (Cohen, 2015, p. 36)</p>
            <p>Therefore, one can see that a project to do a nonhuman narrative is destined to fail. But such narratives hold a certain value that can enlighten us the limits of centrality of humans in history.</p>
            <p class="quote-text">“Inhuman agency undermines our fantasies of sovereign relation to environment, a domination that renders nature “out there,” a resource for recreation, consumption, and exploitation.” (Cohen, 2015, p. 9)</p>
            <p>As a result, he reshapes and questions the central role of the humans in the history, and the world in general. The book received the René Wellek Prize from the American Comparative Literature Association in 2017.</p>

                    <p>They all emphasize that the matter is lively, intelligent and self-organizing. Materiality is not passive but plays active role in shaping our realities. This also means a rejection of essentialism - stating that there is stable essence of objects.</p>

                    <h2>Interdisciplinary Approaches</h2>
                    <p>All the scholars advocate for breaking the disciplinary distinctions in understanding of the world by blurring the boundaries between the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. Moreover, what is intriguing is that all these theorists come from different fields of interest and come together on this common ground.</p>

            </div>
            <p>To sum up, new materialism is a diverse and interdisciplinary field of inquiry that challenges the traditional ways of understanding reality, knowledge, and power. It emphasizes the active and relational role of matter in shaping human and non-human experiences and expressions. It also offers new perspectives and methods for studying the complex and dynamic assemblages that span across natural and cultural realms.</p>

            <h1>Future Directions</h1>
            <p>As discussed above, theories falling under the broad umbrella of 'new materialism' share some common themes: Critique of Traditional Dualisms, Relational Ontology, Materials as active and vibrant, and Interdisciplinarity. But, after exploring Aldo Leopold's classic Thinking Like a Mountain (1949) and Cohen's Stone: An Ecology of the Inhuman (2015), I have tried to give a peak into the possibilities of non-anthropocentric histories. These are to serve as an inspiration for the new generation of environmental historians to explore and understand the past, with an understanding that transcends our specisim. It is a difficult task, but perhaps an important one for our current climate crisis to understand that it is not only about us.</p>
