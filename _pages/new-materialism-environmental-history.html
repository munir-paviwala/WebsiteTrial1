      # New Materialism & Environmental History
      In this project, I highlight and explore the theories which are often called together as 'new materialism'. Following that, I highlight how this theory can help shape a new kind of environmental history - a way of history which de-centers the humans from the narratives of environmental history. I argue that new materialism can offer a nuanced and complex understanding of the interaction between the humans and non-humans in the past.
