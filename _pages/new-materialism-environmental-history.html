      <h1> New Materialism & Environmental History</h1>
       <p>In this project, I highlight and explore the theories which are often called together as 'new materialism'.</p>
      <p>Following that, I highlight how this theory can help shape a new kind of environmental history—a way of history which de-centers the humans from the narratives of environmental history.
      </p>
        <p>I argue that new materialism can offer a nuanced and complex understanding of the interaction between humans and non-humans in the past.

        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p> This website-essay will explore the various theories under the roof called 'new materialism', and then try to understand how these might be affect the ways in which we study environmental history. To understand how such histories are possible, this online project will explore the case of a two of the major works that have taken steps in such a direction. It ends by highlighting some of the limitations of such narratives, and with a note on the future direction of research.</p>

      <p>Have you ever considered how the objects around you affect your life and the world? If so, you might be interested in learning about New Materialism.
</p>
​<p>Broadly, New Materialism is a theoretical framework that emphasizes the active role of material things and the material world in shaping human experiences and social structures.</p>
      <p style="color:red;">It challenges traditional dualisms between the <b>human and non-human</b>, mind and body, and <b>nature and culture.</b></p> 
<p><b>Now, what does that mean?</b></p>
<p>To illustrate what New Materialism means in practice, let’s take a look at an example that might help us; the example is <b>‘Smartphone usage’</b>.</p>
